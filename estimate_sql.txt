-- This procedure provides duration estimate of a dml or ddl operation. For this particular example we are going to estimate on how long
   it will take to create an index for a particular table. Note however that the accuracy of the estimation relies on SYSTEM statistics 
   as well the the object statistics of the corresponding object involved.
   
   
-- The DDL operation we want to run 
    explain plan for create index track_written_timestamp_idx  on  FOX5MGR.FOX_THREAD_TRACKS nologging  (track_written_timestamp) online;
   
-- Show estimates
   select * from table(dbms_xplan.display);
   
   
   Things to check to ensure optimum accuracy 
   
   - select * from sys.aux_stats$
   - select count (*) from <table>
		- check the estimated number of rows vs actual number of rows
   - If there is a wide gap then manually gather the stats for the object
   EXEC dbms_stats.gather_table_stats('FOXMGR','FOX_THREAD_LOG',cascade=>TRUE);
