-- Finding Plans



1.Explain plan 
	usage:
		explain plan for {your select statement}
		select * from table(dbms_xplan.display);
	
Notes:
	Disadvancetages:
		Has no idea of the datatype behind bind variables
			makes it impossible for the optimizer to consider some indexes that would otherwise be available
			
		Doesn't take into account for bind variables which when Oracle first parsed the sql
		
2.Autotrace
	usage:
		set autotrace on
		set autotrace traceonly
		set autotrace traceonly explain
		set autotrace traceonly statistics
		set autotrace off
			
Notes:
	Essentially a shorcut for explain plan
	You can limit the output to just plan , stats and both plan and stats without actually executing the statement
		This is not true when executing DML statements such as insert, update and delete as the statement actually gets executed
		
	
3.dbms_xplan.display_cursor()

	usage:
		dbms_xplan.display_cursor({sql_id},{child_number},{format options})
		select * from table(dbms_xplan.display_cursor);


Notes:
	Returns the run time execution plan of the last sql statement that you have executed
