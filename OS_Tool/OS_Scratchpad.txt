OS tools 

-- CPU utilization with 3 second sampling and 9 datasets
sar -u 3 9

-- vmstat version
vmstat 3 9

-- top and start looking on the top of the page which shows a summary instead

-- Looking at what a particular process is currently doing
strace -p <pid>

-- Where does this OS tool get the OS datasets
vmstat
	/proc/stat

	
-- Oracle perspective -- cumulative
col stat_name for a20
select stat_name, value
from v$osstat -- where does oracle get this data from?
where stat_name in ('BUSY_TIME', 'IDLE_TIME')

Lets strace MMNL which is apparently the oracle process responsible for  collecting osstat
 ps -ef | grep -i mmnl
strace -p <pid> 2> /oracle/out.ou

if you search for "proc" within the logfile what you would fine is that it gets the data from 
	open("/proc/31520/stat", O_RDONLY)      = 9
	read(9, "31520 (ora_pmon_ec3dev) S 1 3152"..., 999) = 262
	
-- Calculate CPU utilization from v$osstat. COntinue doing this on an AWR report Bookmark Util 04

	-- Time Used
	select stat_name, value /100  from v$osstat 
	where stat_name  = 'BUSY_TIME'
	
	-- Time available
	select stat_name, value * 3600  from v$osstat 
    where stat_name  = 'NUM_CPUS'
