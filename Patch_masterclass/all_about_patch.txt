Automated patching notes -- Testing the October 2017 CPU patching

	cd to the patch directory
	$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch prereq CheckConflictAgainstOHWithDetail -ph ./
	

-- How to apply One off patch on a newly created completely unpatched database

Current Patch 
	26713565 -- October_2017 Release
	
1. Rollback all patches
	$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch rollback -id  26713565
	$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/datapatch -verbose
	
2. Apply  25397136 (Proactive Bundle Patch ) then apply the one off patch 18795927

Solution:
	By switching to Proactive Bundle patch just to be able to apply the one off patch we are still going to get the latest patches as it comes
	albeit a quater delayed and definitely a different path than your typical PSU
	
	Basically either follow PSU or BP
