Re-pointing redologfile to a different location

Summary: Depending on the situation such as whether it is a straight up restore or duplication, you might want the metadata regarding redo logs
to be repointed somewhere else in terms of OS physical directory. This particular example encapsulates a duplciation scenario where post duplication
the redo logs are still pointing to the source database. The aim of this procedure that re-point to the redo logs to a new one that we just created

1. Ensure that the target database is on mount mode. 

2. Manually create the redo log files to the designated directory
	cd /oracle/fra/edust1/onlinelog
	
3. Connect to the target database as sys and start repointing the redo logs to the new designated directory

Original one:
	select * from v$logfile order by group#
	
	  1         ONLINE  /oracle/oradata/edudev3/redo01.log
	  2         ONLINE  /oracle/oradata/edudev3/redo02.log
	  3         ONLINE  /oracle/oradata/edudev3/redo03.log
	  
Repointing example:

	ALTER DATABASE RENAME FILE '/oracle/oradata/edudev3/redo01.log', '/oracle/oradata/edudev3/redo02.log', '/oracle/oradata/edudev3/redo03.log' 
    TO '/oracle/fra/edust1/onlinelog/redo01.log', '/oracle/fra/edust1/onlinelog/redo02.log', '/oracle/fra/edust1/onlinelog/redo03.log' 
	
Example result:
	1         ONLINE  /oracle/fra/edust1/onlinelog/redo01.log
	2         ONLINE  /oracle/fra/edust1/onlinelog/redo02.log
	3         ONLINE  /oracle/fra/edust1/onlinelog/redo03.log
