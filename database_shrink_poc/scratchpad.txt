Export:
	perform the export on a non active database 
		mount mode or restricted mode
		
	perform a flashback export. by default exports are only consistent per table basis.
		Solution
			Perform point one instead of active database
			Add flashback_time=systimestamp -- would have to rely on the space of undo 
	
Import
	Include the following parameter on the parameter file
		exclude=table_statistics -- you can then subsequently gather stats when the import has been completed
