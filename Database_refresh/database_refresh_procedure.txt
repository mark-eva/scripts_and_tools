------------------Checks
Number of tables
	col owner for a30
	select owner, count(*) number_of_tables from dba_tables where 
	owner != 'SYS' and owner like '%MGR%' 
	or owner like '%APPENV%' group by owner
	order by 2 DESC
	

	
	
Notes
	- Some directories owned by SYS is obviously not imported
	- JAMESMGR.INBOX table failed to be created
	- MVIEW, sysnonyms, public and all other objects can be verified by checking dba_objects
	- Check jobs are good

-- Checks and solution

Invalid objects
	Issue:
		Compared source and target. Small number of pl/sql packages have been indentified. 
		
	Solution: 
		Show error. and provide the missing grant usually in the form of dbms_lock
		recompile the packages
